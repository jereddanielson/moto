                        <p class="text-center" style="font-family:CrimsonTextBoldItalic;font-size:46px;color:#c6b17c;line-height:1.2;margin-bottom:3rem;">I fell in love with the practice of yoga at a local gym.  It was 2001, and I tried it as a way to heal some injuries after practicing Tae Kwon Do for many years.  Yoga awakened me to a timeless, eternal pull of wisdom that enthralls my Spirit.</p>    
                        <p class="text-center" style="font-family:CrimsonTextRoman;font-size:22px;">In 2009, I met Anand Mehrotra, Master Teacher and Founder of Sattva Yoga, a fresh and ancient holistic yoga practice born out of the Himalayas, India. I immersed myself in this profoundly healing practice and discovered it to be a way of life.  Sattva Yoga touched every dimension of my being on and off the mat.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="font-family:CrimsonTextRoman;font-size:22px;">As can be seen in the award winning documentary, “The Highest Pass,” Anand led a handful of students on motorbikes up to the supreme peak of the Himalayas.  I am fortunate to be one of yogi riders who got to participate in this adventure of a lifetime. This journey liberated and freed me from fear that I didn’t understand. You can read more about this adventure of a lifetime in the <strong>Moto</strong> section.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="font-family:CrimsonTextRoman;font-size:22px;">Fear leaves little to no room to love, enjoy life, and to grow and I want to experience all of it!  I devoted myself to this practice and I am now certified as a 500 hour Master Level Yoga Instructor, (RYT 500).<br /><strong>Stay tuned for local Sattva Yoga events!</strong></p>
