            <p style="font-family:CrimsonTextRoman;font-size:22px;">With three decades of experience, I am a seasoned guru of UX/UI Design for Motion, Broadcast, and Commercials. A passionate collaborator, I breathe life, and the essence of humanity into your design or prototype.</p>
            <p style="font-family:CrimsonTextRoman;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:30px;">As an inventor of large company patents, I understand visionaries, and just how significant great new ideas can be. Your new idea may pave the way for an industry to move forward, just as my collaborative contributions at Microsoft did. We created Metro, a design language described by multiple industry experts as, "sleek, quick, and modern," aimed to give the user the impression of an "alive" and responsive UI with "an added sense of depth." Metro laid the foundation for the future of today. And, there's 3D Map Typography, another collaborative contribution that changed the world of motion.</p>
