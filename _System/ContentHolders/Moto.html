                            and abroad in India.</p>    
                        <p class="text-center" style="font-family:CrimsonTextRoman;font-size:22px;">I came fully alive while biking up to the uppermost point of the Himalayas under the guidance of Anand, a guru who taught me how to transcend my consciousness. <span style="font-family:CrimsonTextItalic;">“The Highest Pass”</span> is an award winning documentary that witnessed my experience. Since then, I’ve brought my son to India several times, and while I won’t be taking you to the highest pass, I invite you to shake out fear with other like-minded folks during a spiritual bike ride of a lifetime.  Stay tuned for particulars about upcoming moto adventures in India and in the US, coming soon!</p>
